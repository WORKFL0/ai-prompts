## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the AI Prompts repository seriously. While this repository primarily contains text-based prompts, we recognize that security considerations may arise.

### What to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities if you discover:

- Prompts that could potentially be used to generate harmful, illegal, or unethical content
- Prompts that could be exploited to bypass AI safety measures
- Documentation or examples that inadvertently promote unsafe AI usage
- Repository infrastructure vulnerabilities (GitHub Actions, templates, etc.)

### How to Report

**For security vulnerabilities:**
1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email us at: [your-email@domain.com] (replace with actual contact)
3. Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
4. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

**For prompt safety concerns:**
1. Create a private issue using GitHub's security advisory feature
2. Or email us directly with details about the concerning prompt

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- Description of the vulnerability or safety concern
- Specific prompt(s) or files affected
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact or misuse scenarios
- Suggested remediation (if you have ideas)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Assessment:** Within 1 week
- **Resolution:** Varies based on complexity, but we aim for quick fixes

### Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing prompts, please:

1. **Review for Safety:** Ensure prompts cannot be easily modified to generate harmful content
2. **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Don't include real personal information, API keys, or credentials in examples
3. **Consider Misuse:** Think about how a prompt might be misused and add appropriate warnings
4. **Test Responsibly:** Test prompts with safety in mind, not just functionality
5. **Report Concerns:** If you notice safety issues in existing prompts, please report them

### Safe AI Usage Guidelines

We encourage responsible AI usage:

- Use prompts ethically and legally
- Respect AI platform terms of service
- Consider the impact of generated content
- Verify important information from AI responses
- Be transparent about AI-generated content when appropriate

### Disclaimer

The prompts in this repository are provided for educational and productivity purposes. Users are responsible for:

- Complying with applicable laws and regulations
- Following AI platform terms of service
- Using generated content responsibly
- Verifying accuracy of AI-generated information

We cannot guarantee the safety or appropriateness of all possible outputs from these prompts when used with different AI models or in different contexts.
