## Example Usage

**Input:**
- Story Type: Short Story
- Genre: Sci-Fi Mystery
- Target Audience: Adult
- Setting Preference: Near Future

**Output:**
1. **Core Concept:** In 2035, a memory restoration clinic helps trauma victims recover lost memories, but when a client's restored memories don't match historical records, the therapist discovers someone is manufacturing false memories on a massive scale.

2. **Main Character:** Dr. Elena Vasquez, 34, a neural memory specialist who lost her own memories in a car accident five years ago. She's methodical but struggles with trusting her own perceptions, making her both the perfect detective and unreliable narrator.

3. **Conflict:** Elena must uncover the truth about the memory manipulation conspiracy while questioning whether her own restored memories are real, all while the conspiracy targets her for elimination.

4. **Supporting Elements:**
   - Marcus Chen: A former patient whose "false" memories led him to discover his family's hidden criminal past
   - The Aurora Protocol: A classified government program that may be behind the memory manipulation
   - Memory artifacts: Physical objects that trigger real memories, serving as the only way to verify truth

5. **Plot Twist Ideas:**
   - Elena's car accident wasn't accidental—she discovered the conspiracy five years ago and they tried to erase her memories
   - The "false" memories being implanted are actually real memories from people who were forced to forget them

6. **Opening Scene Suggestion:** Elena watches security footage of herself from five years ago, seeing herself frantically trying to hide something she can't remember, while her current patient describes impossible memories of events that never happened.
